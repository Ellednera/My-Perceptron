    * validate: take_mock_exam, take_lab_test
    * test:  take_real_exam, work_in_real_world
    * generate_confusion_matrix: get_exam_results
    * display_confusion_matrix: display_exam_results
    * save_perceptron: preserve
    * load_perceptron: revive

Version 0.03    19 AUGUST 2021
* The followings have been implemented:
    * confusion matrix
        * read only expected and predicted columns, line by line
        * return a hash of data
            * TP, TN, FP, FN
            * total entries
            * accuracy
            * sensitivity
    * display confusion matrix data to console
        * use Text:Matrix
        
Other modifications:

        * write predicted values into original file
        * write predicted values into new file
    * test method
        * read csv bulk
        * write predicted values into original file
        * write predicted values into new file


Version 0.01    8 AUGUST 2021
* First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
